# Cloud-File-security-using-threshold-cryptography

Abstract:-

In present era, Cloud Computing has gaining much importance due its facility of providing data access to multiuser anywhere around the world if required. User is relying on Cloud for the large amount of data it has.
But what if the data stored in the cloud is being misused, or if it being deleted, or being used as agent to destroy oneâ€™s business. By taking this into consideration we have decided to generate a system to provide security for files in cloud. The aim is to secure the data by encrypting the data at the user level then encapsulated by the header for providing security. This data will then be sent to the cloud for storage.
